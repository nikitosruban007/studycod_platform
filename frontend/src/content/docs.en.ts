## StudyCod — a platform to learn programming

![StudyCod overview (EDU vs Personal)](/docs/overview.svg)

StudyCod has **two modes**:

- **EDU**: learning in a class (teacher ↔ students), topics, control/self-study works, gradebook, announcements.
- **Personal**: individual tasks and progress, no classes.

### Who is it for
- **Student**: solves tasks, passes control/self-study works, sees grades.
- **Teacher**: creates topics/tasks/control works, sets deadlines, manages the gradebook.
- **Admin**: system settings (if enabled).

### Main areas
- **EDU → Lessons**: topics and control works assigned to you.
- **EDU → Gradebook**: grades by topic/task/control work.
- **Announcements**: teacher messages for the whole class (can also be emailed).
- **Docs / Wiki**: this help center.

### Terms (quick)
- **Topic (TOPIC)**: a set of practice tasks.
- **Control/Self-study (CONTROL)**: one final grade (quiz + practice by formula).
- **Thematic grade (INTERMEDIATE)**: an optional intermediate grade created in the gradebook.

### Quick links
- EDU (student): \`/edu/lessons\`
- EDU (teacher): \`/edu\` → classes
- Docs: \`/docs\` or \`/edu/docs\`

## FAQ

### Why is the UI mixed-language?
Because some strings were hardcoded, or some EN translation keys were missing. If you spot any, tell me the exact page and label.

### How do I add screenshots to Docs?
Put the file into:
- \`frontend/public/docs/screens/\`

Then reference in markdown:
- \`![Description](/docs/screens/my-screenshot.png)\`

## Troubleshooting

### A page doesn't scroll in EDU
The EDU shell uses \`overflow-hidden\`, so pages must define their own scroll container (flex + min-h-0 + overflow-y-auto).

### A grade is not visible
Check:
- whether the task is assigned
- whether grades were deleted on unassign
